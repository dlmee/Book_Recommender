### Initial Exploration of Data

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
setwd("/home/dlmee/Info523/Book_Recommender")
getwd()
result <- read.csv(file = "Books.csv")
ratings <- read.csv(file = "Ratings.csv")
#reviews <- read.csv(file = "Users.csv") I don't think we'll end up using this. 

search <- ratings[ratings$Book.Rating != '0',]

#Get rid of rows that occur less than 60 times. This is making sure that we're only getting reviewers who consistently review. 
df2 <- search %>%
  group_by(User.ID) %>%
  filter(n() >= 60)

# Find everyone who rates at least one a ten, make it distinct
df3 <- df2 %>%
  filter(grepl('10', Book.Rating)) %>%
  distinct(User.ID, .keep_all = TRUE)

# Find users who rated at least 4 books a 10
features <- df3 %>%
  group_by(ISBN) %>%
  filter(n() >= 4) %>%
  distinct(ISBN, .keep_all = TRUE)

superusers <- pull(features, User.ID)
superbooks <- pull(features, ISBN)

# Just in case we're curious
curious <- result[result$ISBN %in% superbooks,]





#Now to build the features function. 
featselect <- function(superusers, ratings){
  features <- list()
  for (super in superusers){
    step <- ratings %>%
      filter(grepl(super, User.ID))
    feature <- list()
    for (row in 1:nrow(step)){
      allusers <- ratings %>%
        filter(grepl(step[row,2], ISBN)) %>%
        filter(grepl(step[row,3], Book.Rating)) %>%
        pull(User.ID)
      #print(c("Finished a run:", row, length(allusers)))
      feature <- c(feature, list(allusers))
    }
  feature <- unlist(feature, recursive = TRUE)
  feature <- unique(feature)
  print(c("finished a feature:", length(feature)))
  features <- c(features, list(feature))
  }
  return (features)
}

features <- featselect(superusers, search)

# Let's write that to a csv
capture.output(features, file = "features.csv")


#Let's see how much these two intersect, I'm pretty happy with this. 85 overlap between collectively 1600 in a pair, fairly distinct.
#If we wanted we could remove these users...I'll leave them for now. 
for (i in 1:length(features)){
  base <- features[[i]]
  for (j in 1:length(features)){
    if (i < j){
      reach <- features[[j]]
      br <- intersect(base, reach)
      brfinal <- paste("Comparing", i, "with", j, "matches =", length(br), sep = ' ')
      write(brfinal, file = "similarity.txt", append = TRUE)
    }
  write(" ", "similarity.txt", append = TRUE)
  }
}


#Now with these lists of users, we simply need to go one step further, and add their scores to a row, so we have pairs of ISBN and cumulative scores. These will be one step prior to our true features

# We'll need a df with a single column that has all items. 
items <- result %>%
  select(ISBN)

#Let's transform this into a function.

feat2item <- function(features, items, ratings){
  for (i in seq_along(features)){
    title <- paste("feature", i, sep = '')
    items <- items %>%
      mutate(
        title = 1
      )
  draw <- ratings %>%
    filter(User.ID %in% feature[[i]])
  for (row in 1:nrow(draw)){
  cbook <- draw[row,2]
  cscore <-draw[row,3]
  original <- level2[level2$ISBN == cbook,] %>%
    pull(title)
  level2[title][level2['ISBN'] == cbook] <- cscore + original
    }
  }
  return (items)
}

write.csv(itemfeatures, file = "itemfeatures.csv")





#Finally we need to apply this to USER and ITEM, such that every user has each feature score, and every item has each feature score. This will be our true feature matrix.



```
### Practice
These are some aspects of R that I needed to understand in order to succeed on this project
```{r}
# lists

#This is just to practice with lists a bit
  telist <- list()
  telist <- c(telist, list(superusers))
  telist <- c(telist, list(superbooks))
  teunlist <- unlist(telist, recursive = TRUE)

# Modifying elements of a dataframe

  level2['currentfeat'][level2['ISBN'] == '0195153448'] <- 24
  find <- level2[level2$ISBN == '0195153448',] %>%
    pull(currentfeat)

#Interacting with pipes and dplyr

  # An example of select and mutate
  items <- result %>%
    select(ISBN) %>%
    mutate(
      currentfeat = 0
    )


  #An exmaple of filter and %in%
  draw <- search %>%
      filter(User.ID %in% tester[[1]])
  
#Using the intersect function
  crosscut <- intersect(features[[1]], features[[7]])

#Using the paste function
 brfinal <- paste("Comparing", i, "with", j, "matches =", length(br), sep = ' ')
```
